## Problem 1: [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)

Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

Example 1:
Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Example 2:
Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array. 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
