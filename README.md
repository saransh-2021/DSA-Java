# DSA-Java


### Rules

1. **Daily Question**: Each day, one question will be sent out to solve at any time within the day. If I am unable to provide the question, anyone can send it to the group.

2. **Time Allocation**: Allocate 40 minutes to construct the algorithm, 20 minutes to write the code, and 20 minutes for debugging. If you cannot construct the algorithm within 1 hour, review the solution.

3. **Solution-First Approach**: Use a solution-first approach: solve the question with whatever answer you can think of, then enhance your knowledge by reviewing top-performing solutions and consulting AI tools.

4. **Language and Platform**: The programming language is Java, and the platform is LeetCode.

5. **Question Schedule and Solving Flexibility**: DSA questions will be shared with links in this format: Monday-Thursday one/two easy questions, and Friday-Saturday one medium/hard question. The difficulty level will increase as we progress. You can choose to solve all questions one day before the meeting or solve them regularly every day.

6. **Weekly Meetings**: Weekly meetings will be held every Sunday to discuss the answers and explain your thought process to others. The meeting time and link will be shared on the day itself. The role of discussion leader will rotate to ensure everyone gets a chance to lead and explain their solutions.

7. **GitHub Repository**: You can make your repo public or private. If you choose a private repo, share it with collaborators so others can view your solution. If you have already solved some DSA questions before, create a new branch and push your current streak there. Document your initial thought process and the improved solution after research in a markdown file alongside each code.

8. **Shared Resources and Prizes**: A shared document or repository for useful resources like tutorials, articles, or cheat sheets will be available. Prizes will be awarded for mastering key concepts or problem types.

9. **Review Documentation**: Document anything noteworthy for later revision in the review.md file that was pushed alongside your solution.
