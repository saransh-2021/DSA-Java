## Problem 1: [Linear Search](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/linear-search-in-c/)

Problem Statement: Given an array, and an element num the task is to find if num is present in the given array or not. If present print the index of the element or print -1.

Example 1:
Input: arr[]= 1 2 3 4 5, num = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is present in the 2nd index

Example 2:
Input: arr[]= 5 4 3 2 1, num = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: 5 is present in the 0th index



## Problem 2: [Check if an Array is Sorted](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/check-if-an-array-is-sorted/)

Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.

Note: Two consecutive equal values are considered to be sorted.

Example 1:
Input:
 N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output
: True.
Explanation:
 The given array is sorted i.e Every element in the array is smaller than or equals to its next values, So the answer is True.

Example 2:
Input:
 N = 5, array[] = {5,4,6,7,8}
Output
: False.
Explanation:
 The given array is Not sorted i.e Every element in the array is not smaller than or equal to its next values, So the answer is False.

Here element 5 is not smaller than or equal to its future elements.
